Running the program
-------------------

You can start the program by executing the jar file that is built in the target/jfx/app folder "OutlawEditor-jfx.jar"   Depending on your platform you might be able to double-click it.  Or you might have to drop to the commandline and issue this command after going to that directory, like so:

> java -jar OutlawEditor-jfx.jar

Building the program
--------------------

First time building: Open the pom.xml file and double-check that you have the javafx jars in the same location indicated for the javafx dependency.  Adjust the jar file location as needed (if needed at all -- A compile error is a sure bet you have to do something about it.

If you have an IDE that understands Apache Maven projects, then open this project in your IDE and build from there.  I cannot stress how much easier this is than doing things manually.  But if you insist on doing it the hard way, then "mvn install" should be sufficient to build the program if you have already installed Maven 3 and it is in your bin path and properly configured.

With Netbeans, you should be able to open this project directly.  For Eclipse you should be fine as long as you have Indigo (3.7) or later and the m2eclipse plugin, with which you import this project into your workspace and go from there.

Before you build the first time, you will see all kinds of compile errors all over the source tree.  That's because part of the program gets generated during the build process.  Try doing a clean build and see if that resolves the issues before jumping into panic.
